Sheckle duplication script for Grow a Garden

To use:

1. Open Roblox via the website
2. Open Grow a Garden
3. Ask a friend/other player to hold out an item
4. You should now start getting cash
5. This script works by duplicating and selling the item, so it is limited by framerate*

You may need to download Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)


Upd. 1.1:
*I have now modified it to have an option to save the item into your inventory instead of selling automatically.
